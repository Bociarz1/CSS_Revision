---------TRANSITION------------
allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

All propeerties:
transition          : A shorthand property for setting all the transition properties
transition-delay    : delaf of changes
transition-duration : how long changes can last
transition-property : what you want to change (all/font-size/color/bgc)
transition-timing-function : 
    ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
    ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
    ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
    ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

---------TRANSFORM------------
property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
if you write a few properties in one line and want to change ONLY ONE: 
div {transform: rotate(20deg) translate(20px,0) ...}
in div:hover you must repeat{ rotate(1000deg) translate(0)} <- deafult write translate(0)

---------ANIMATION------------
allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash

In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:
@keyframes	                      Specifies the animation code
animation	                        A shorthand property for setting all the animation properties
animation-delay	                  Specifies a delay for the start of an animation
animation-direction	              Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles
animation-duration	              Specifies how long time an animation should take to complete one cycle
animation-fill-mode	              Specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both)
animation-iteration-count	        Specifies the number of times an animation should be played
animation-name	                  Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation
animation-play-state	            Specifies whether the animation is running or paused
animation-timing-function	        Specifies the speed curve of the animation
